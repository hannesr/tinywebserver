Tinywebserver
-------------

A very small Java webserver that is used as a library attached
to a java application, applet, Android application or service,
or any other Java 1.6 or above software.

The library will serve HTTP 1.1 requests from memory. The code
that integrates Tinywebserver will need to implement the actual
content being served, through very simple interfaces.

Tinywebserver is best suited for simple HTTP integrations where
purpose is to use HTTP as a communication method between
components or applications, and a simple all-purpose embedded
web server implementation is needed.
